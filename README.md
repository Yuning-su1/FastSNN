# FastSNN

FastSNN is a developer-friendly SDK for building, training, and deploying **Spiking Neural Network (SNN) models**.  
Inspired by the algorithms introduced by BICLabâ€™s *SpikingBrain* project, FastSNN provides a simple, consistent interfaceâ€”bringing SNN development closer to the usability of mainstream deep learning frameworks.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **One-line SNN building and training**  
  Create, train, or convert from ANN to SNN with concise APIs or CLI commands.

- **Unified SNN file format (.snn)**  
  Standardized model packaging for cross-platform deployment and long-term storage.

- **End-to-end workflow coverage**  
  From model definition, training, context extension, evaluation, to deploymentâ€”all in one toolkit.

- **SpikeTensor abstraction**  
  A core data structure unifying dense activations, spike counts (sINT), and event-based streams.  
  Built on the `Coder â†’ NeuronCell` pipeline, it ensures ANN-like interfaces while retaining SNN semantics.

- **SpikeScope visualization**  
  A built-in tool for raster plots, sparsity curves, membrane potential traces, and throughput profiling.  
  Designed to make SNN evaluation interpretable and reproducible.

## ðŸš€ Quick Example
```python
from fastsnn import FastSNN

# Build a tiny SNN model
model = FastSNN.build(arch="snn-tiny", d_model=256, n_layers=4, n_heads=4)

# Train on WikiText
trainer = FastSNN.fit(model, dataset="wikitext/wikitext-2-raw-v1", seq_len=2048, max_steps=1000)

# Extend context length (2k â†’ 8k)
FastSNN.extend_context(model, trainer, new_seq_len=8192)

# Generate visualization report
FastSNN.scope(model).report("runs/exp1")

# Export and serve
FastSNN.export(model, "artifacts/my_model.snn")
FastSNN.serve("artifacts/my_model.snn", port=8000)
